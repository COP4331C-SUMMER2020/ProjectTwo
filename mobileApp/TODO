write-up plan for getting this shit done on time


TODO for mobileApp team:

1: Get someone to baby-sit me in making my current repo commit to GitHub with the
    working mobile React App so I don't mess it up. (Make File formatting look good)
2: Ask Leinecker how to make a custom 'useApiEndpoint();' hook that can be called
    from both the React webApp and the ReactNative mobileApp because I still don't
    fully understand hooks enough to write custom hooks and I need help
3: Finish making custom API hooks that can be imported that will handle all POSTs and Receive all data needed from api endpoits
4: Make a basic bare-bones page for each api endpoint (Honestly guys, I can't guarantee we will able to implement all the endpoints on mobile,
                                                      so here are the must have endpoints implemented on mobile from a UX perspective)
5: Finish routing for all the pages


   *Pages that MUST be implemented for mobile app: 
   (Other endpoints are stretch goals)
6:    -createAccount/log-in/log-out (reset password might be for website only) (easy)
7:    -inserting/deleting ingredients from the user's pantry (easy)
8:   *-search for a recipe (dynamically be able to display hundreds of recipes to choose from them)(hard)
9:    -Display searched for recipe using Stack routing *talk to be if interested in how that works


TODO for Airam specifically:
Know how make styles for all ReactNative elements we are going to use
  *Example: <View></View>, <Button/>, ect..
-Play around with my App.js code i (will have) committed, and see if you can
 make shit look good. For now I'll focus do the routing, api-endpoints, and

   |  Example: <Views></Views>, <Buttons/>, ... ect
   |
   |      Don't do much with headers if at all, we can get by with a basic one.
   |      The pages are what we need to work

Note to Airam: Don't worry about
